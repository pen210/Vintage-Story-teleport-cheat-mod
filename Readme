🎮 TeleportMod Creation Story - 3 Days of Hell
What is this mod?
A simple teleportation mod for Vintage Story. Open the menu, enter coordinates from the minimap - and teleport there. You can save favorite locations. Everything simple... or so I thought.

📅 Day 1: "Fuck, this is easy!"
Thought I'd make it in an hour. Got coordinates, got teleport, what could go wrong?
Attempt 1:

Enter 10 10 10
Gets thrown to who knows where, minimap shows -511680 320 -511680
WHAT THE FUCK???

Turns out the game has two coordinate systems:

What the minimap shows
What the game uses internally

And they're NOT THE SAME.
Attempts 2-5:
Tried different conversion coefficients:

32 (doesn't work)
51201 (total disaster)
32768 (also shit)

Each time teleported to the wrong place. Either 2 million blocks away, underground, or into complete void.
Day 1 result: Nervously smoking. Mod didn't work.

📅 Day 2: "FINALLY WORKS!... no, fuck"
In the morning found a solution! Used one formula - and IT WORKED!
Happily teleporting around the world. Everything's perfect!
But then...
Joined a server to test. Entered coordinates and...
TELEPORTED TO +2 MILLION BLOCKS.
I just sat there staring at the screen. How??? Why???
Turns out each server/world has its own offset. What worked in singleplayer - didn't work on the server.
Day 2 result: Wanted to quit everything. But already spent 2 days, gotta finish it.

📅 Day 3: "I FUCKING BROKE IT!"
Spent the whole day searching how to make it work EVERYWHERE.
Tried automatic offset detection - doesn't work.
Tried manual configuration - also some shit.
Tried reading coordinates differently - again fuck all.
And then found one thing in the game code - DefaultSpawnPosition.
It's like the world's spawn point. And THE MINIMAP SHOWS COORDINATES RELATIVE TO IT!
THERE IT IS, THE KEY TO EVERYTHING!
Rewrote the code. Tested:

✅ Singleplayer - works
✅ Server - works
✅ Another world - works

FUCK YEAHHH! FINALLY!

💀 What I went through:

🔥 3 days of continuous debugging
😤 7+ attempts at different solutions
🤬 Hundreds of failed teleports
☕ Lots of coffee and swearing
😭 Almost quit several times
🎉 But didn't give up!


🎯 What came out in the end:
A simple mod that:

Works on any world/server automatically
Teleports exactly where you need
Lets you save favorite locations
Has a clean menu without bullshit

User only needs to:

Open the mod
Enter coordinates from minimap
Press the button

THAT'S IT. IT WORKS.

💬 Advice for those who will make mods:
If something doesn't work - don't give up. I fought with coordinates for 3 days that either worked or didn't. Wanted to quit many times. But finished it and now have a working mod.
P.S. If your stuff also doesn't teleport where it should - first look for where the game stores spawn point. It saves lives 😅
